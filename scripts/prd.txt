# Development Roadmap  
## Phase 1: MVP Foundation
- Basic HTML structure with proper semantic markup
- CSS implementation of TeamUp design system (colors, typography, spacing)
- Responsive layout framework with centered video positioning
- Hard-coded Vimeo embed with proper aspect ratio handling
- "Back to Coaching.com" button with brand-consistent styling
- Mobile-responsive design testing

## Phase 2: Enhanced User Experience
- Smooth transitions and hover effects for interactive elements
- Loading states for video player
- Error handling for video embed failures
- Accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Performance optimization for video loading

## Phase 3: Backend Integration (Future)
- Database schema for video link storage
- Admin interface for adding/editing video links
- Dynamic video loading from backend
- Video metadata management (titles, descriptions, categories)

# Logical Dependency Chain
1. **Design System Implementation** (Foundation): Must establish brand-consistent styling first
2. **Basic Layout Structure**: Create responsive grid system and centered video positioning
3. **Video Embed Integration**: Implement Vimeo embed with proper responsive behavior
4. **Navigation System**: Add "Back to Coaching.com" button with proper styling
5. **Responsive Testing**: Ensure all elements work across different screen sizes
6. **Polish and Refinement**: Add subtle animations and final design touches

# Risks and Mitigations  
- **Video Loading Performance**: Implement lazy loading and proper error states
- **Responsive Video Behavior**: Use CSS aspect-ratio and viewport units for consistent sizing
- **Brand Consistency**: Strict adherence to brand.json specifications with design review
- **Browser Compatibility**: Test across major browsers and implement fallbacks
- **Future Backend Integration**: Design frontend architecture to easily accommodate dynamic content

# Appendix  
- **Brand Guidelines**: Complete implementation of TeamUp design system from brand.json
- **Video Embed Best Practices**: Vimeo embed API documentation and responsive design patterns
- **Accessibility Standards**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for inclusive design
- **Performance Targets**: Sub-2-second page load times with optimized video loading
